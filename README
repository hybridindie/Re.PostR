Re:PostR - Where LifeStreaming and Tumblogging come to have a baby.

The web is social and blogging is hard, we don't have time if you actually want to have a life outside of an office. Yet, it takes very little time to check Twitter, Facebook, or the social flavor of the day. Combine that with quick services like Tumblr or Posterous and you have nice ADD perfection. Things shouldn't be hard and things should take long to perform. This is the long term goal of Re:PostR.

** State **
Pre Pre Alpha - I just started this so no it barely does anything, watch as I work on this daily and things are beginning to move along.

** Requirements **

Rails 3
RSpec / Cucumber
DB of Choice (I'm developing it using SQLite, but it works with MySQL and PostgreSQL; and as things move forward it will also work on MongoDB cause it's better for this type of thing)
HAML/SASS

Modern Browsers cause it uses HTML5 and CSS3
